## Logging setup

To setup logging you can add two environment variables or just use defaults.

1. LABS_LOG_PATH="your/desired/path" (relative to your home directory)
2. LABS_LOG_LEVEL="debug" (you can use upper or lower case, doesn't matter)

If you don't set them, the default value for path is ~/devnetlabs/logs/ and for log level
it is set to info.

On Windows systems the home directory should be C:\Users\<username>
